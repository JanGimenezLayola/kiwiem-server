# GTH-Barcelona-ConsoleLu
Project submission for the `Global Travel Hackathon in Barcelona, by console.lu team`.

**Write one sentence explaining what does your project.**
Our idea is to make travelling more accessible for people with special needs. For this reason we create Kiwi-them, which is an app that will connect volunteers with people that needs help during the trip.
